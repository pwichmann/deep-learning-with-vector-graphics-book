This tool aims to address the problem of neural networks producing invalid (not well-formatted XML) SVG ouput.

"This tool converts a txt file containing text generated by a neural network trained on Scalable Vector Graphics (svg files) into two directories, one containing the valid svg files produced, and one containing the invalid svg files produced. This tool's key feature is that it attempts to correct every invalid file."
