# Academic papers

This section aims to:
  1. provide a collection of relevant academic papers
  2. explain them in detail
  3. ideally reproduce the results and discuss these critically

In order to be relevant, papers need to discuss the use of Deep Learning in combination with vector graphics, such as SVG or other stroke-based graphics.
