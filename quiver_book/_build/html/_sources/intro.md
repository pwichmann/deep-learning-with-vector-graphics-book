# Deep Learning with Vector Graphics

**By Pascal Wichmann**


## About

This book aims to introduce the domain of applying Deep Learning to [vector graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics), such as [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG), and to identify and summarise relevant prior work.

In this sense, this book also serves as an hommage to those amazing scientists and/or artists who paved the way, such as David Ha ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/hardmaru), [Website](https://otoro.net/ml/)).
