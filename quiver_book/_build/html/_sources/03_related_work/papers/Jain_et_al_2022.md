# Jain et al. (2022) | VectorFusion: Text-to-SVG by Abstracting Pixel-Based Diffusion Models

Jain et al. propose a text-conditioned diffusion model trained on pixel representations of images which can be used to generate SVG-exportable vector graphics. Their work is based on the differentiable render DiffVG by Li et al. (2020)
