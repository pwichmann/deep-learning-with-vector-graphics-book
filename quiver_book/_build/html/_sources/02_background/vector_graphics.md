# Vector Graphics

This section aims to summarise relevant background knowledge on the topic of Vector Graphics.

The most common file format on the Web is *Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)*. 

Other file formats for vector graphics are:
* WMF (Windows Metafile)
* EPS (Encapsulated PostScript)
* PDF (the Portable Document Format developed by Adobe)
* CDR (the file format used by Corel Draw, a vector graphics editor)
* AI (the file format used by Adobe Illustrator, a vector graphics editor)

Given the popularity of SVG in the internet and, thus, the availability of data in this format, the focus will be on SVG.
