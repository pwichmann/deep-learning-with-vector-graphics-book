# Challenges of Vector Graphics

This section aims to summarise why vector graphics, and SVG specifically, are challenging to work with in the context of Deep Learning.

## Why Vector Graphics (e.g. SVG) are challenging

Key challenges are the following:

1. Deep Learning models expect a numeric tensor. SVG files, however, are XML text in the first instance.
2. SVG files are hierarchical / a graph of nodes and attributes.
3. There are *many* ways to design an SVG that results in the same rastered PNG.
4. SVG allows for simple paths, b√©zier curves as well as other pre-defined SVG primitives (such as rectangles, circles etc.).
5. Translating an SVG to its visual representation is not trivial and not as straightforward as it is for a raster image with (R,G,B) pixel values.

Further challenges include:

* SVGs have an x,y coordinate system of a certain size; in addition only a certain part of it may be defined to be shown to the user (viewport)
* SVGs can contain animations and all sorts of other Web technology (scripts, ...) that need to be ignored.
