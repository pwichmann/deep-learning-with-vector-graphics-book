# Vinker et al. (2022) | CLIPasso: Semantically-Aware Object Sketching

The work by Vinker et al. (2022) differs from the other key papers referenced in this book. The CLIPasso model is able to convert a (raster) image of an object into a drawing in vector image format (SVG).
The required abstraction skills are obtained from the [CLIP model](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) which is able to distill the semantic concepts from both images and sketches.

This paper was presented at SIGGRAPH 2022.
