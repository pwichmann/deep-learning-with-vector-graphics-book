[Vectoglpyh](https://www.fluate.net/en/travaux/vectoglyph) is a project of the Franco-Swiss artist and researcher in digital art Nicolas Boillot.

Boillot treated SVGs as simple ASCII text sequences and trained OpenAI's GPT-2 algorithm on them.

## SVG icons

In one artistic experiment, Boillot trained GPT-2 on an icon dataset, 1700 emoji from the Twemoji (Twitter emoji) collection. The quality of the results, despite being artistically interesting, is expectedly not overwhelming.
