# Sam Greydanus (2016) | Scribe: Generating Realistic Handwriting with TensorFlow

In August 2016, Sam Greydanus publishes a blog post based on the Graves (2014) paper. In the blog post, he explains the approach and also provides the code and a Jupyter notebook to reproduce the handwriting example.
The Jupyter notebook is well-written with useful explanations.

The code is based on Python 2.7 and TensorFlow 1.0.
