# Key academic publications

This section aims to:
  1. provide a collection of key academic papers in the context of deep learning with vector graphics
  2. explain them in detail
  3. ideally reproduce the results and discuss these critically

In order to be relevant, papers need to discuss the use of Deep Learning in combination with vector graphics, such as SVG or other stroke-based graphics. The distinction between key and further academic publications is subjective but shall help papers with a larger contribution not to get overlooked in the ocean of papers out there.

The explanations for each paper freely mix content from the papers with own attempted explanations and illustrations.
